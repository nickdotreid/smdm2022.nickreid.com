		<p>This work about educational resources for lung transplant for advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease is part of a larger project called <a href="https://takeontransplant.org">Take on Transplant.</a>
		<p>An overview of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocac176/6730798">our full design process is published in JAMIA.</a></p>
		<p>More details about the usability study -- including participant preferences about content, afforances, and timing of lung transplant education -- will be presented at AMIA 2022, an <a href="/Reid%20-%20AMIA%202022%20-%20Usability%20preferences%20of%20people%20living%20with%20cystic%20fibrosis">"in-press" version of the paper is available here</a></p>

		<h2>How people living with cystic fibrosis prefer to use an educational website to support shared decision making about lung transplant</h2>
		<p><em>Nick Reid, MHI, Kathleen J. Ramos, MD MSc,  Mara R. Hobler, PhD, Lauren E. Bartlett, BS, Joseph B. Pryor, MD, Donna L. Berry, PhD RN, Melissa J. Basile, PhD, Siddhartha G. Kapnadak, MD, Andrea L. Hartzler, PhD.</em></p>
		<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Understand how people living with cystic fibrosis (CF) prefer to use lung transplant (LTx) educational resources for shared decision making (SDM) with their care team.</p>
		<p><strong>Methods:</strong> By conducting a mixed-methods usability study of educational website prototypes among people living with CF, we elicited preferences about their use of didactic and experiential content when considering LTx. Whereas didactic content communicates clinical knowledge via articles, experiential content communicates lived experience via patient stories. Although educational resources providing both didactic and experiential content can improve knowledge in preparation for SDM about LTx, they must be usable and useful to people living with CF.</p>
		<p>To investigate preferences, we created two website prototypes that people living with CF used in scenario-based tasks. The "Author-Driven" prototype presented structured didactic and experiential content based on a self-assessment survey. Comparatively, in the "Reader-Driven" prototype let participants freely browse didactic and experiential content. Participants rated each prototype with the System Usability Scale (SUS), and then described their preferences for educational content and prototype design during an exit interview. We analyzed SUS scores with descriptive statistics. Interview recordings were analyzed deductively.</p>
		<p><strong>Results:</strong> Fourteen people living with CF who had not received LTx participated. The Reader-Driven prototype received a higher mean SUS score than the Author-Driven prototype (M=90.0 vs M=81.6, p=0.002). When learning about LTx, participants preferred to navigate between didactic and experiential content in the Reader-Driven prototype -- searching for "hidden gems" (Participant #4). Participants described the Author-Driven prototype's recommendations as a valuable starting point for learning. Participants indicated that didactic content was important to understanding illness trajectory, and could help them initiate SDM with providers. They found experiential content could improve knowledge and reduce fear, but was emotionally difficult to read.</p>

		<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Participants preferred to use educational resources as part of an active process where deliberation is informed by sensemaking with both didactic and experiential content. Study results informed an educational website that we are evaluating through a longitudinal study. This educational tool could support people with other types of advanced lung disease with similar needs and preferences.</p>
